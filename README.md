## Overview

This project was originally created for a talk done at Minnebar 2023 (and again at DeveloperWeek 2025). The talk is about how to sync design and development as much as possible. We asked ChatGPT for website ideas for this talk, and the suggestion we went with was a conspiracy theory website. We thought the idea was funny, rest assured we don't believe any of the theories on this fake website!

## Running the App

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can hide or show the grid overlay on the homepage by commenting/uncommenting the `GridOverlay` component in `/src/components/pages/HomePage/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
